How do I approach designing software?
The first thing necessary when developing software is establishing and understanding all requirements. This project was broken down into smaller parts where each successive build was presented to the 'client' and had feedback before continuing. Developing modular code helped with testing and debugging, allowing issues to be pinpointed and addressed quickly. Utilizing prototypes for gathering client feedback promotes engagement and results in an end product matching what the client desires. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach new projects by outlining all requirements before beginning. I figure out what sort of frameworks and libraries will be applicable and serve the project needs. Once development begins I stick to coding best practices such as utilizing frequent comments and formatting for readability, modular design, and object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. For this particular project all object data was abstracted to their own classes which helped to clean up the rendering function and maintain readable code. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This career promotes critical thinking and problem solving. The field is constantly changing with new technologies and better ways of doing things, requiring computer scientists to constantly adapt and continually learn throughout their career. Computer science helps to build these skills and promote an active learner mindset that will benefit in any future career position.
